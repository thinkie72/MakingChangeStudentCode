| January 27 | 8:55-9:55am |     I came up with an idea that I think will work, involving a tree that continually removes coins that has already exhausted all possibilities. I'm still not sure how I'm going to implement it. Hoping to make more progress soon... |
| January 28 | 1:55-2:25pm | I talked with Mr. Blick about how and when I will stop including coins. I'm going to use and algorithm that only passes in the original array and index for each recursive call. I think I can do this, but it's time to get to work... |
