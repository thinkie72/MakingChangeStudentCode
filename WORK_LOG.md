| January 27 | 8:55-9:55am |                        I came up with an idea that I think will work, involving a tree that continually removes coins that has already exhausted all possibilities. I'm still not sure how I'm going to implement it. Hoping to make more progress soon... |
| January 28 | 1:55-2:25pm |                    I talked with Mr. Blick about how and when I will stop including coins. I'm going to use and algorithm that only passes in the original array and index for each recursive call. I think I can do this, but it's time to get to work... |
| February 2 | 7:45-8:15pm | I thought a lot about what my specific approach would be, and I found a good one I think. I'll use each recursive call to look for the ways including and excluding each number from greatest to least. This should work, I'm excited to get it working... |
| February 2 | 8:15-8:45pm |      I got it working! I ended up using a 2d array instead of an array of arraylists to speed it up since I would have to fill each with -1 from 0-->target+1. This worked super well. I'm really excited to see what's in store during tomorrow's lesson! |
